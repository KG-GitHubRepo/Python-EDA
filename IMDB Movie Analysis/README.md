## Problem Statement:

We have a list of the 100 best-rated movies from the last 10 years. For each movie, we also have details about its actors, the people who voted for it, and other related information like ratings and earnings.

The task is to write Python code to explore this data and discover interesting facts. For example:
  * Which movies got the highest ratings?
  * Which actors appeared most frequently?
  * How did different voters rate these movies?
  * Which movies made the most money?

In short, weâ€™ll use data analysis in Python to turn numbers and tables into meaningful stories about these top 100 movies and the people who love them.
